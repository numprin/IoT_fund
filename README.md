Final project 

Encryption: Write two python scripts. 
Jack & Jill: Share a symmetric key secretly using either Diffie-Hellman algo. or an asymmetric encryption.
Jack: Send the cipher text of "Hello World!" using the shared key.
Jill: Using a hash function to generate a cipher text of "Hello World!" and save it in a file name called 'passphase.txt'. Decrypted the cipher text received from Jack. Hash the received text and compare it with the hashed pass phase in the file. They should be identical!
